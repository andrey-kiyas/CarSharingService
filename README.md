<h2 id="introduction"> Introduction</h2>

Car Sharing Service App is a car rental application with JWT authorization to secure access to the application. Users
are divided into managers and clients to separate rights in the application. Notifications that a rental has been
created, paid or expired are sent to the user via a Telegram bot. They can be adjusted at the discretion of the
application administrator. Stripe API was used as a payment system. Payments are secure and if there is an error the
transaction will be cancelled.
